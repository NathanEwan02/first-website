            <h2>Hobbies and Character</h2>
            <p>A big part of my life has always been creative endeavours. I was first introduced to music, which I have been 
                persuing since the age of 11. My first instrument was the drums, which I've been playing for 7 years now.
                I later picked up the piano and recently the guitar. These pursuits have defined me as a person over the last few
                years, driving me to seek more challenges and problems to solve. This is why I have sought out a career in web development,
                it

            <h2>Education and Skills</h2>
            <p>I attended Calvary Christian college for my highschool education and graduated there at the end of 2020
                While I was there, I helped serve different roles for the school, demonstrating my leadership and commitment
                to helping the school. I was a part of two musical teams and helped with events and part of the Year 12
                cohort. I also studied a subject called 'digital solutions' covering various programming and IT related topics.
                This is what encouraged me to engage more with programming as i prepared in 2021 to enroll as a student in CoderAcademy.
                My Knowledge and skills in coding have increased greatly during the last year and now I have a good understanding of 
                data structures, algorithms, object oriented programming, html, css and javascript.
