## Functionality / Features

### Home Page 1:

This first image is a screenshot of the top of the home page. All of the four pages contain the nav bar at the top of the screen with hyper links to each page, displayed as flex inside the header. Below that is the main section of the page with a h1 title of my name, paragraph to give a brief description of myself and a button that will take the user to the contact page. next this is an image of me with a coloured border for added style. When the page is reduced to 480px the photo will then disapear to make room for the text. 

### Home Page 2:
![Homepage#2](documentation/Homepage#2.png)

In the middles section of the home/index page there are three cards layed out into three columns in a grid. Each card gives a general overview of my current skills and experience. All three have been stylized with rounded edges and turqoise border with a box shadow. When the screen is reduced to 960 pixels, a media query will sort the grid layout to be one column so that it better fits a tablet screen. The same thing happens when the screen width goes below 480px.

This screenshot the bottom section of the contains an image of my resume in the center of the page. Below that there is a link to the pdf document of that same resume. As the page reduces in size to the tablet screen and mobile screen, the image takes up more space.

### Home Page 4:

The Final image above displays the footer. This footer remains consitent throughout the pages. The footer uses flex to display the three icons and uses 'justify content' to evenly space the content. Each icon is a link to a different site to get into contact with me.

The lower half of the contact page is a form with an input for email and an input for text. This is still a work in progress, future iterations of the website will be coded in javascript to send messages to my email from the website.

## Tech Stack
This website is static and only uses html and css to display the pages on screen. Netlify was a website used to deploy my website on their servers so that it can be viewed by employers and users. Javasript has not been used however it will be used in future iterations.
